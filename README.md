# Automacorp backend

## Note : This is <b>not</b> the backend used alongside my Automacorp frontend. The one that is used with the frontend is [here](http://github.com/erwinmartin06/automacorp).

This is the backend of the Automacorp project done during the web, mobile and embedded programming courses. The goal was to simulate a building, its rooms, windows, heaters, temperature sensors,... to use electricity more wisely during winter.

This backend is powered by
 - Spring
 - H2
 - Swagger
 - Gradle
 - Junit
 - Mockito


## Requirements

The programming and testing were done on OpenJDK v17.0.8.1, Spring v3.2.1 and Gradle v8.5. So be sure to have it installed.

```sh
